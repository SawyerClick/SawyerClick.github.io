# Hi, I'm Sawyer
I'm a New York-based data viz nerd. I have projects below that showcase my sweet skills in Python, Illustrator and D3.js, but this secret section is dedicated to how cool I am. I'm a north Texas native with an obsession over punk music, which I played a lot of during my undergrad career at Texas State University, which I graduated from in 2019 with a B.S. in journalism and a minor in music. In my free time I play Overwatch, pet Chunkie, my dog, and riff hard on my guitar.

Well, it's at <a href='https://sawyerclick.github.io'>sawyerclick.github.io</a>

It houses all my graphics, coding and reporting samples. The most recent one's will be my graphics, as I'm at Columbia Journalism School getting my M.S. in Data Journalism.

I'm learning skills like D3.js, Python, Illustrator, ai2html, machine learning, Flourish, and a million more. Check out my <a href='https://github.com/SawyerClick/SawyerClick.github.io/blob/master/Sawyer-Click.pdf'>resume</a> for the full list.
