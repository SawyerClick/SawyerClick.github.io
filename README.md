# This is my portfolio site!!
Well, it's at <a href='https://sawyerclick.github.io'>sawyerclick.github.io</a>

It houses all my graphics, coding and reporting samples. The most recent one's will be my graphics, as I'm at Columbia Journalism School getting my M.S. in Data Journalism.

I'm learning skills like D3.js, Python, Illustrator, ai2html, machine learning, Flourish, and a million more. Check out my <a href='https://github.com/SawyerClick/SawyerClick.github.io/blob/master/Sawyer-Click.pdf'>resume</a> for the full list.
