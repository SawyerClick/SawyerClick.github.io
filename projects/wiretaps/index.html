      <h2 class="subhead">Wiretapping has been on the decline for the past few years. Drug-related cases dominate the state-level, but there's been a sharp drop off in the number of cases reported by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts on behalf of the Federal Judiciary.</h2>

      <p class="body-text serif">The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts released the <a href='https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/wiretap-report-2018' target='_blank'>Wiretap Report 2018</a> at the turn of the year. The federal government, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and 44 states have laws permitting "wire, oral, or electronic surveillance", according the the report. Twenty-seven of these jursidictions reported using wiretapping during 2018.</p>
        
      <p class="body-text serif">The report shows that over the past year, wiretapping itself has been on a decline. The dip started following 2016's report and has carried over into 2018's, with a 23% decrease in authorized wiretaps between 2017 and 2018.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Drugs still dominate the declining reports</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Drug-related wiretapping, consisting of the offenses labelled as "Narcotics", "Drugs", "Drugs - Illegal" and "Drugs - Prescription", consistently consumed a vast majority of the intercepts. In 2013, drug-related wiretaps made up 92% of state-level wiretaps. That number has dropped steadily, with an exception of a spike in 2015. Now, per the 2018 report, drug-related intercepts sit at 77% of the year's total.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">Each state had an average of 38.62 drug-related wiretaps. California, New York, New Jersey, Texas and Illinois had 46% of these wiretaps. When accounting for population, Vermont and New Mexico had the most wiretaps per capita, nearing 10 per 1 million people. In these states, respectively, cannabis is recreationally legal and medicinally legal. The three states in which cannabis is entirely illegal, Louisiana, Nebraska and Idaho, are dispersed throughout the upper, middle and lower portion.</p>

        <p class="chart-subhead">When geographically charted, clusters show concentrated areas. The southwest, the northeast and parts of the midwest have a high concentration of drug-related wiretapping. Other areas, like the northern midwest, have little to none.</p>

          <p class="chart-subhead">Based on the charts below, Alabama appears to be one of the most cost-effective states. It ranks lower for money spent and arrests, but it ranks second for convictions, indicating the arrests were more meaningful.

          <p class="chart-subhead">On the other side, Illinois is the least cost-effective. At a little over $2 million, the state ranks 6th in total money spent. There were no reported convictions, despite having 21 arrests.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text serif">For the most part, states in which cannabis is entirely illegal do not have a substantial number of reported wiretapping incidences.</p>
