Or, maybe, not a test</h1> <p class="lead">I&#x27;d like to see how you&#x27;re doing. You can use your notes/homeworks/etc and googling, but no asking people.</p> <hr> <p><strong>That means no help from me, TAs, or other students.</strong></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12"> <h3>Chart 1: Scatter plot</h3> <div class="alert alert-warning"> If you find something especially hard, or your code keeps breaking, just hit undo until your graph kind of works and skip to the next part or problem. </div> <p>Use <code>player_stats.csv</code> to make a scatterplot of NBA players.</p> <ul> <li>Height goes across the bottom, weight goes up and down</li> <li>Color each point based on the player's position</li> <li>Size each point should be related to the average points scored per game</li> <li>Since the points will be overlapping, make each point a little transparent</li> <li>Graphic should be 600 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall. Margins are up to you.</li> </ul> <div id="chart-01"> </div> <div class="hints"> <p><strong>Hints:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Cut and paste all of the margin/height/width/inserting svg code from other work you've done</li> <li>Honestly cutting and pasting an entire scatterplot might not be a bad idea. Then just change the scales and the column names.</li> <li>Make sure you have <code>import * as d3 from 'd3'</code> at the top to pull in D3</li> <li>The <code>Pos</code> column is position, <code>Height</code> and <code>Weight</code> are what you'd expect. Points per game is <code>PPG</code>.</li> <li>Pay attention to capitalization, it matters!</li> <li>Set the bounds of your scales to be something that makes sense visually.</li> <li>Maybe start with 0-260 on height and 0-200 on weight, then work on centering</li> <li>No player averages more than 30 points per game</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12"> <h3>Chart 2: Scatter plot</h3> <div class="alert alert-warning"> If you find something especially hard, or your code keeps breaking, just hit undo until your graph kind of works and skip to the next part or problem. </div> <p>Use <code>player_stats.csv</code> to make another scatterplot of NBA players.</p> <ul> <li>Position goes across the bottom, weight (kg) goes up and down</li> <li>Make the graphic a little more narrow.</li> <li>Color each point based on the player's position</li> <li>Make the points all the same size</li> <li>Give me a little spacing between the axis lines and the circles</li> </ul> <div id="chart-02"> </div> <div class="hints"> <p><strong>Hints:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Cutting and pasting from the last chart is a good idea, but remember to change the div you're pointing at</li> <li>The only positions in this dataset are: <ul> <li><code>PG</code> (point guard)</li> <li><code>SG</code> (shooting guard)</li> <li><code>PF</code> (power forward)</li> <li><code>C</code> (center)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Yes, I asked for spacing, but don't try to start your <code>xPositionScale</code> at anything other than zero.

hard, or your code keeps breaking, just hit undo until your graph kind of works and skip to the next part or problem. </div> <p>Make a horizontal bar graph using <code>animal-counts.csv</code>.</p> <ul> <li>The animals should be on the y axis</li> <li>Pink bars should represent how many animals are in each group</li> <li>The maximum number of animals should be 100</li> <li>The bars should take up about 75% of their space (aka there should be padding between them)</li> </ul> <div id="chart-03"> </div> <div class="hints"> <p><strong>Hints:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Cut and paste all of the margin/height/width/inserting svg code from other work you've done</li> <li>When you cut and paste, remember to change the id of the div you're looking for</li> <li>Think about what kind of scale you're using</li> <li>I already gave you a hint</li> <li>If you call it <code>widthScale</code> your axis code might break</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12"> <h3>Chart 4: Dynamic bar graph</h3> <div class="alert alert-warning"> If you find something especially hard, or your code keeps breaking, just hit undo until your graph kind of works and skip to the next part or problem. </div> <p>This chart should also be a bar graph using <code>animal-counts.csv</code>, but the y axis and bar widths should automatically update if we change in new data.</p> <ul> <li>Should look the same as above</li> <li>If you change the dataset to <code>animal-counts-2.csv</code>, it should still work</li> </ul> <div id="chart-04"> </div> <div class="hints"> <p><strong>Hints:</strong></p> <ul> <li>You should probably cut and paste from the last graph, but remember to change from <code>chart-03</code> to <code>chart-04</code></li> <li>It will probably look a little different than Chart 3, don't worry</li> <li>You'll want to update your scale domains after reading in your data</li> <li>If your bars look too long, remember D3 reads everything in as strings so you need to do a little something extra</li> <li>Test by switching between <code>animal-counts.csv</code> and <code>animal-counts-2.csv</code></li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div

kind of works and skip to the next part or problem. </div> <p>Use <code>product_sales.csv</code> to draw a line graph.</p> <ul> <li>Year is the x axis, sales is the y axis.</li> <li>The graph should be 680 pixels wide, 300 pixels tall</li> <li>The coffee line should be <code>red</code>, everything else should be <code>lightgrey</code></li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-8"> <div id="chart-05"></div> </div> <div class="col-12 mt-3"> <div class="hints"> <p><strong>Hints:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Cut and paste all of the margin/height/width/inserting svg code from other work you've

Interactive graphic</h3> <div class="alert alert-warning"> If you find something especially hard, or your code keeps breaking, just hit undo until your graph kind of works and skip to the next part or problem. </div> <p>Copy the code from Chart 1, and make the graphic interactive.</p> <ul> <li>Hovering over a player should put a black border around their circle</li> <li>Hovering over a player should display their name and team name to the right</li> <li>Clicking on a button should highlight those kinds of players (you can decide what that means)</li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-8"> <div

<li>You'll want to make the graphic more narrow</li> <li><code>hover</code> is <strong>not</strong> an event</li> <li><code>Team</code> is the column for the team name</li> <li>You'll need to edit the
